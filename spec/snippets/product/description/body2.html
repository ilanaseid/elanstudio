Unable to find the understated, elegant clothes she craved, RaphaÃ«lla Riboud took matters into her own hands. She looked to her sari-wearing Indian grandmother and the nonchalance of English dandies to create a line of loungewear made from fabrics traditionally used by couture houses (Riboud spent three years at Dior). Made in France, this set elevates the everyday PJ with a long-sleeve, pocketed shirt and tapered pant, both in effortless black silk.
