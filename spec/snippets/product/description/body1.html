Self-taught perfumer Heather Sielaff originally created this spicy scent as an antidote to the nine-month rainy season in her hometown of Portland, Oregon. With notes of cardamom, Indonesian vetivert, and wood, Darkwave’s mood-boosting powers are just as effective outside of the Pacific Northwest—and anywhere you tote this bottled-to-order rollerball.
