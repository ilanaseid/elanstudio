The traditional Hammam towel gets updated for the modern bath—and beyond. Scents and Feel’s signature Fouta is hand-woven in Tunisia of 100% natural cotton that gets softer and more absorbent with each wash. In a luxurious herringbone weave with two thin black stripes, it’s a quick-drying addition to your bathroom or beach bag and at 38” x 78”, doubles as a table runner, throw, or light blanket.
